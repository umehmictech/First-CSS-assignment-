        <p>Before it was called Nigeria, the country was known as the Royal Niger Company Territories, which was a collection of territories along the Niger River. This name was changed to the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914, and eventually became the independent nation of Nigeria in 1960. The area began to come under British control in 1861 and was made a British colony in 1914. Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and became a republic in 1963. Ethnic strife soon led to military coups, and military groups ruled the country from 1966 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1999.</p>
